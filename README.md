###RandomTweaks
*RandomTweaks* is a mod I'm creating as I'm trying to learn about Minecraft modding. My favourite mods are Gregtech, Tinker's Construct, Applied Energistics, Iguana Tweaks for Tinker's Construct and Hunger Overhaul.

Features:
* Snow Buckets: Crafted using a snow block and an empty bucket. These can be smelted into a water bucket
* GT Aluminium is now compatible with Tinker's Construct Aluminium
